									<p>Accreditation is a formal, third party recognition of competence to perform specific tasks. It provides a means to identify a proven, competent evaluator so that the selection of a certification body is an informed choice. UKWWA accreditation means the organization/institution can demonstrate to its customer that it has been successful at meeting the requirements of international accreditation standards.</p>
									<p>Accreditation by UKWWA means that evaluators: testing and calibration laboratories, inspection and certification bodies have been assessed against internationally recognised standards to demonstrate their competence, impartiality and performance capability.</p>
									<p>Accreditation is a process by which Companies, organizations, and educational institutions are reviewed to determine whether they meet the standards of the accrediting body. Accredited status is not permanent; it has to be renewed through periodic review.</p>
									<p>In the United Kingdom, academic accreditation is voluntary and decentralized; it is carried out by many non-governmental, non-profit organizations. Accreditation may be either institutional or programmatic, and is a voluntary, comprehensive, and objective process of outside peer review to determine whether an institution or program meets the standards of the accrediting body in institutional and/or educational quality and effectiveness.</p>
									<p>United Kingdom World Wide Accreditation Awarding Body accreditation is not a ranking system; rather, it is a form of quality assurance, declaring to the relevant professional community and to the world at large, that a program meets the quality standards set by the technical profession.</p>
									<p> The accreditation applies to programs only, not degrees, departments, colleges, institutions, or individuals.</p>
