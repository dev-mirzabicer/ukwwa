										<h1>Our Mission</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Welcome to United Kingdom World Wide Accreditation Awarding Bod. We have a simple mission: to help people make more of their lives through learning.</p>
									<p>Our mission is to promote quality-oriented continuing education and training. We seek to identify, evaluate and enhance the delivery of continuing education and training. We are committed to self-regulation through independent peer-review and evaluation; and, we aspire to the continuous refinement of our recognition as a valid and reliable authority.</p>
									<p>Whether it's at home, in the classroom or in the workplace, learning is the key to improving our life chances. To this end, Pearson in the UK brings together leading names in education to provide a blend of content, curricula, assessment, training and technology to make learning more engaging and effective.</p>
									<p>We are a private UK's Awarding Body. We offer academic and vocational qualifications that are globally recognised and benchmarked.</p>
									<p>Our vocational qualifications are recognised in more than 70 countries worldwide.</p>
									<p>By bringing together international assessment and education experts, United Kingdom World Wide Accreditation is developing World Class Qualifications that empower learners to develop important skills to make progress in their lives through learning. Setting a new gold standard in education, with unrivalled support for teachers and students every step of the way, Pearson is committed to education and achieving long-term learner outcomes.</p>
									<p>Our vision is to set the global standard for listening and responding. We put our success down to our core values of quality, value, service and integrity.</p>
									<p>We work with experts and leaders in the education sector to make sure that we maintain high standards across all our qualifications. The United Kingdom World Wide Accreditation Board, our World Class Qualifications Expert Panel and the Qualifications and Standards Committee are a key part of our commitment to these standards.</p>
