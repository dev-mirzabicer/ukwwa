									<h2>Qualification certification</h2>

									<p>Our qualification certificates are evidence of your learners' hard work and achievements. Certification ensures that appropriate management systems meet relevant international standards thereby, ensuring consistency of products and services being produced and supplied through the implementation of continuous quality assurance processes.</p>
									<p>Companies of all sizes and industry sectors choose to be certified either through choice to reduce their risks, or as a consequence of legal requirements such as health and safety regulations.</p>
									<p>Management systems standards are the most widely used examples of certifications used by business, industry and commerce.</p>

									<h2>Vocational certification</h2>
									<p>The award documentation will show the month and year in which a programme was completed. The month will be printed on all award documents unless you request otherwise.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Certificates</h2>
									<p>Certificates are issued to centres weekly. They're normally sent by recorded delivery or courier. We reserve the right to withhold certification if fees are outstanding at the time of dispatch.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Course Assessment Report (CAR)</h2>
									<p>This is a hard copy list of grades reported for all learners, produced weekly, showing the current status of the learner. This report is for reference purposes only. No action is needed - we'll query any problems separately.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Evidence of achievement</h2>
									<p>Where a learner doesn't fully complete all the elements of a programme, and doesn't claim the final award, a unit certificate will be issued automatically. It will list all units successfully completed.  This document gives evidence of unit completion so that successfully completed units can be used as credits in the future. It allows learners to retake or add units under the same registration free of charge while registration is still valid.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Notification of performance / Certificate of Unit Credit</h2>
									<p>Learners who are registered on a programme of study that doesn't lead to a full award, or who don't get the qualification they were registered for, may claim a Certificate of Unit Achievement or Fallback Certificate of Unit Credit. This document is a cumulative record of success to date, but doesn't state the title of the programme for which the learner was originally entered.</p>
