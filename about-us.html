										<h1>About United Kingdom World Wide Accreditation Awarding Body</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Here at United Kingdom World Wide Accreditation Awarding Body we are committed to high standards of educational excellence and to accrediting higher education programs as well as professional education programme. We aim to achieve our continued commitment by providing the following services.</p>
									

									<h2>Accreditation of Programmes</h2>
									<p>We establish academic, institutional, ethical and business standards; examine and evaluate programmes in terms of these standards; and grant accreditation to education programmes from all over the world.</p>

									<h2>Degree Recognition & Evaluation Certificate</h2>
									<p>We also take part in international credential evaluation by recognising qualification alignments in terms of UK qualifications and credit framework. Those who graduate from accredited institutions or programmes can be sure and show that their diploma, credits earned and the institution where they earned these are accredited in accordance with the United Kingdom World Wide Accreditation Awarding Body standards by requesting a Recognition Certificate.</p>
									<p>Our organisation was created in order to validate higher education programmes offered overseas in terms of qualifications alignment to UK Qualifications and Credit Framework based on standards that are relevant and applicable to all higher education programs globally and which support and encourage excellence in higher education worldwide.</p>
									<p>As with all UK Supporting Bodies for accreditation we are a self-accredited organisation. UK Supporting Bodies for accreditation are established in their own rights and are self-regulated bodies. Recognition by UK Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) affirms that standards and processes of Accrediting Bodies are consistent with quality, improvement, and accountability regulations that UK HEPISG has established.</p>
									<p>An accredited course is defined by HESA as one which is recognised by an accrediting body and may confer membership, chartered status or partial exemption. Accreditation may be 'any process of approval leading to assurance that a programme meets the standards required by a particular profession'.</p>
									<p>Organisations that undertake accreditation of HE programmes and are identified through a KIS will be asked to provide relevant information on their own websites explaining in general terms the purposes of accreditation of higher educational programmes and the potential benefits to students.</p>
									<p>The United Kingdom World Wide Accreditation Awarding Body complies with the requirements for HESA KIS registration, as PSRB (Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body) for programme accreditation. According to the HEBRG (Higher Education Better Regulation Group) one of the roles of a PSRB may be to accredit programmes of higher education, either directly or through institutional accreditation. HEPISG, the Higher Education Public Information Steering Group, has ultimate responsibility for information contained within and developed for KIS. While certain functions associated with professional accreditation are devolved to HEFCE, HESA, QAA and HEBRG, HEPISG's decisions are final over inclusion to the list of accrediting bodies.</p>
									<p>The United Kingdom World Wide Accreditation Awarding Body also takes part in international recognition of qualifications alignment to UK Qualifications and Credit Framework. The recognition certificates are recognised by professional bodies for certified memberships, by higher education institutions for further studies and by employers. The United Kingdom World Wide Accreditation Awarding Body supporting body for accreditation is registered in the United Kingdom.</p>
